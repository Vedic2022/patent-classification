# patent-classification
This project proposes an automated patent classification method by using deep learning algorithms for supervised multilabel patent category prediction. The proposed model used patent text fields such as title, abstract and first claim for creating word embeddings. Further, extracted features from patent images also considered for improving the overall model accuracy.
